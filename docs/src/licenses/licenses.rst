  translating suite, the Docutils.

* :doc:`shdoc<shdoc>` - shdoc is a documentation generator for
  bash/zsh/sh for generating API documentation in Markdown from shell
  scripts source.

* :doc:`bash-unit<bash-unit>` - bash_unit allows you to write unit tests
  (functions starting with test), run them and, in case of failure,
  displays the stack trace with source file and line number indications
  to locate the problem.

  linting tool for sh/bash scripts.
